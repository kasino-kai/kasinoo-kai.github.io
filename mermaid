I detailed a path about 2 ways to get rich, with one being winning the lottery, and the other being using what im learning now to get a hot wife and have kids with her and live happily ever after. i did some research and found out how to color the boxes.
for some reaosn the code will work on live editor but not here. Each box is jus another step on the path and this flowchart is just a simple way to show how mermaid works.
